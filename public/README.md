# Sentra

**Sentra** is a developer visibility and control dashboard that brings clarity across the entire software lifecycle — from preflight validation to post-deploy troubleshooting.

## 🧩 What It Does

- 🪵 **Filtered Logs** — see only what matters for your service
- 🚀 **Deployment History** — know when, where, and how code ships
- 🩺 **Environment Health** — monitor pods and service uptime
- ⚠️ **Preflight Warnings** — catch problems before they hit prod

## 💡 Use Case

Designed for developers and platform engineers who want a single interface to support and maintain services once the code leaves the IDE.

## 📦 Tech Stack

- Next.js
- TailwindCSS (planned)
- Vercel (deployment)

## 🚧 Roadmap Ideas

- Connect to GitHub Actions, Datadog, and Kubernetes APIs
